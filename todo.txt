Todo: 


- code, assembly & project structure cleanup


CORE: some very, very basic stuff for use by all. Units, conversions, utilities, etc. A scripting API may or may not live in here.
VOID: logic / gameplay layer. NOT just the data layer. This is where you define ships, technologies, buildings, game events, game logic, etc.
SCANNER: View layer UI elements, , Monobehaviours, Effect implementation, glitches, prefabs, game objects, it all goes here.
  Scanner should probably be split into two different assemblies because it doesn't seem right to combine the abstractions for UI elements 
  in the same place where you have highly specialized implementation details such as the part that rotates the ship ring or blinks its lights.

Calaby-Yau-Podolsky Harmonic Electromagnetic Resonance : CYPHER

- Layers
    - tactical (50 light seconds / 0.1 AU / 1.5 million km) - even at 1%c, it takes more than an hour to cross this distance. Needless to say, 
    - scanner (scan for oort cloud comets, etc.) - around 500 AU radius (increase by a factor of 5000)
    (stellar (up to 25 light years) )
    ( galactic (up to 125 000 light years) )

    * these all reuse the same code with entities.
    * we start with the SCANNER layer


TECHNICAL WORK
- ui audio
- ui transitions
- ui windows / layers (preventing "fall-through" of UI events)
- working hyperlinks 
- ship / external camera is currently ingame.
- picture-in-picture capability
