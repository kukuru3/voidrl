SHIP CONSTRUCTION
THE FACILITIES PROBLEM
    - engineering facilities 
    - population facilities
    - hydroponics facilities

    Or, solve these by just assigning "modules"
    which then open up INTERNAL SLOTS
    which are displayed via the UI somehow but still tied to a ship part


Structures

 - Radiation shielding
 - Gantry 
 - Maneuver thrusters
 - 

[ ] Colliders on elements for clicking
[ ] Hologlitches of holoshader
[x] mass distribution "point cloud"
[ ] Radial facility: habitation module 
[ ] Solve problem : facility slots are slim
   [ ] Maybe there is no problem. Just enumerate all the facilities you think you need.
   [ ] Zero-G habitat ("small ring"), occupying a single section of a module, with a cylinder that has 6 facility slots
   [ ] 


[ ] Thinner ring spokes (looks better, and is probably more scientifically accurate)
[ ] Autogreebler


CORE: some very, very basic stuff for use by all. Units, conversions, utilities, etc. A scripting API may or may not live in here.
VOID: logic / gameplay layer. NOT just the data layer. This is where you define ships, technologies, buildings, game events, game logic, etc.
SCANNER: View layer UI elements, , Monobehaviours, Effect implementation, glitches, prefabs, game objects, it all goes here.
  Scanner should probably be split into two different assemblies because it doesn't seem right to combine the abstractions for UI elements 
  in the same place where you have highly specialized implementation details such as the part that rotates the ship ring or blinks its lights.

- Layers
    - tactical (50 light seconds / 0.1 AU / 1.5 million km) - even at 1%c, it takes more than an hour to cross this distance. Needless to say, 
    - scanner (scan for oort cloud comets, etc.) - around 500 AU radius (increase by a factor of 5000)
    (stellar (up to 25 light years) )
    ( galactic (up to 125 000 light years) )

    * these all reuse the same code with entities.
    * we start with the SCANNER layer


TECHNICAL WORK
- ui audio
- ui transitions
- ui windows / layers (preventing "fall-through" of UI events)
- working hyperlinks 
- ship / external camera is currently ingame.
- picture-in-picture capability



What do we need?

Ship management:

(base ship view)

to BUILD NEW SHIT on the ship. Also, tear down existing shit. Construction tab.
to CONTROL THE MONKEYS on the ship. Social tab.
to RESEARCH NEW SHIT. Research tab.
to DEFEND OUR SHIT. Military tab. 

Mission control:
to VIEW OUR OVERALL MISSION STATE AND PARAMETERS.
to SEND NIGGAS TO MINE MORE SHIT FOR OUR SHIP SO WE CAN BUILD MORE NEW SHIT. Missions tab.


Topdown approach:

Have MAIN MENU.
It has no eyecatch. Just a title and the main menu.

Not sure what to do with these concepts:
- Observatory 
- Hangar bay ( structural module? or part of Operations module)
- Storm Shelter (could be a facility inside a habitat, or a module)
- Arsenal
- Particle Accelerator
- Hydrolysis separator (this could be implied in life support)
- Storage (is it just a module, like reservoirs? Or Storage Bay)
- 


SIMPLE CONSTRUCTION:

This is similar to X-com's base building.
The ship is divided into pressurized, shielded, separated compartments called MODULES.

Each module gives some basic bonuses (all defense modules employ some sensor technicians, all technical modules give some production)

Some structures may have unclear allegiance to modules; this should not be avoided, but rather be used as a game mechanic. Schools can be in habitation modules, but as a matter of policy, children could be concentrated in special education centers that belong to technical modules.

PRESSURIZATION
- modules are usually pressurized, and most cannot function unpressurized
- modules having their own isolated life support system have much purer air.

ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY
- zero-g habitat modules are possible, but living in zero-g will lead to long-term effects for the population such as lowered productivity and decreased biological integrity
- 1g can only be achieved in a large spinning ring module, or, later a small fast-spinning ring module.
- 1g habitation is coveted. 
- reduced gravity is preferable to no gravity. 
- we could require the player to install a technical module in the base of any spinning module, as the "spinner" structure depends on it. This reduces build diversity.
- Military module in a 1g environment would unlock "high-g training", increasing robustness of the troops.

RADIATION SHIELDING
- in most modules, work areas are shielded from radiation
- rad-shielded modules are much heavier, but offer benefits
- just the existence of rad-shielded modules is sufficient to stratify the society.

DISTANCE AND ADJACENCY
We  run a simple simulation of resource flow. We recognize resource producers, consumers, and 
Resources in this context are power, water, air.

Air needs to be cycled throughout the ship in a closed life-support loop. Purity is tracked in various modules.

Modules can be distributed for redundancy, or joined together for an adjacency bonus.

Radiators lose efficiency the farther away they are from heat sources.
Storage modules should obviously be close to factories processing large amounts of materials.
Reservoirs should be close to reactors.
Habitats should be close to life support.
The route people take from habitats to "work" modules is also tracked. If this becomes too long, it will impact productivity.

ADJUNCT HABITATION:
you can sacrifice a structure slot to have people live in the module where they work. This is not much coveted, as these people can have very little reason to leave their module. This is how you get slums. This is how you get the Independent Republic of Hydroponics C.

ATTACHMENTS:
Observation mast
Railgun 
Reservoirs (propulsion module attachment)
Maneuver thrusters gain a bonus when placed on a propulsion module on a large ring.



- extremes should be viable. "Module soup" where you have one of each is boring and should be discouraged



OR 
distribute as seen fit (2 per segment, one spinal, one ringular)

reactor
propulsion
military
habitat
industry
agriculture
science

central ones are bulkier - while ringular are thinner but can spin.

choose up to one attachment per segment

radiators
engines
reservoirs
storage bays
meteor shield
habitat ring (allows )


modules have immediate benefits, but can also grant structure slots.
Some structures require, and occupy, slots from different modules.
Some structures require power, manpower or cadre.


Example structures:
active magnetic radiation shielding
storm shelter 
high energy laboratory 
plasma centrifuge separator
microlathe 
strike craft hangar
simulator pods
zero-g industry 
water purifier 

criostasis pods
biological storage
nursery

railguns
point defenses
observation mast

We want around 10 segments to start with. This gives us 20 modules + 10 attachments.
Extremes should be viable - like having only 1 science and 5 military modules.
RING modules may be spun (though it's not necessary)

WHAT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE ON THE SHIP?
Some buildings you will only ever need one of, and it's a no-brainer to build them.
So what? That's how it's in Civilization. It does not detract from the design.
It's not just HOW MANY you place.
It's also WHERE you place them. 

Their ship location will influence some events.


It's a problem of varying layers of abstraction.

PROPULSION
ENGINEERING
OPERATIONS
HABITATION 
HYDROPONICS 

Whither : storage, reactor, science, radiators, hospitals, laboratories, manufacturies, simulator pods, education centers, barracks?

So we need to distill this into building blocks:

PROPULSION AND ENERGY
  - engines 
  - reactor core 
  - (optional) parts that influence engine or reactor output, such as injectors
  - radiators

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
  - storage
  - material recycler 
  - hydrolisis plant 
  - separation centrifuge

HABITATION
  most of these REQUIRE LIFE SUPPORT, REQUIRE PRESSURIZATION, REQUIRE GRAVITY
  - life support - handles pressurization
  - habitation complex (slums)
  - medical center - heals injuries 
  - nursery - can be folded into medical center, but you want your kids to grow up radiation free, right?
  - education center
  - recreation center


FOOD PRODUCTION (entirety of food production can be folded into)
  - hydroponic bay / aquaponic bay
  - yeast tanks
  - algae farms 
  - insect bays 

RESEARCH 
  - genetic laboratory
  - materials laboratory
  - physics laboratory

INDUSTRY
  - industrial plant
  - gantry for large ship production 
  - microlathe (advanced industry)

OPERATIONS 
  - maintenance bay 
  - rotator
  - bridge 
  - docking port (atop a long nonrotating shaft)
  - sensor array (antennae)
  - 

MILITARY
  - barracks 
  - weapon bay (railgun, missile silo, point defence)
  - arsenal (storage of volatile munitions)
  - training center 
  - simulator pods 
  - hangar bay
