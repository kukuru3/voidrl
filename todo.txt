Todo: 

- we do not need an ECS it seems. Clean it up and transfer most functionality into 
  entities. Entities should be CONTAIN-able by default.

- Stellar Nav Camera, Zoomer, and various Surrogates are currently a mess.
  Create a better code structure that integrates them


CORE: some very, very basic stuff for use by all. Units, conversions, utilities, etc. A scripting API may or may not live in here.
VOID: logic / gameplay layer. NOT just the data layer. This is where you define ships, technologies, buildings, game events, game logic, etc.
SCANNER: View layer UI elements, , Monobehaviours, Effect implementation, glitches, prefabs, game objects, it all goes here.
  Scanner should probably be split into two different assemblies because it doesn't seem right to combine the abstractions for UI elements 
  in the same place where you have highly specialized implementation details such as the part that rotates the ship ring or blinks its lights.

- Layers
    - tactical (50 light seconds / 0.1 AU / 1.5 million km) - even at 1%c, it takes more than an hour to cross this distance. Needless to say, 
    - scanner (scan for oort cloud comets, etc.) - around 500 AU radius (increase by a factor of 5000)
    (stellar (up to 25 light years) )
    ( galactic (up to 125 000 light years) )

    * these all reuse the same code with entities.
    * we start with the SCANNER layer


TECHNICAL WORK
- ui audio
- ui transitions
- ui windows / layers (preventing "fall-through" of UI events)
- working hyperlinks 
- ship / external camera is currently ingame.
- picture-in-picture capability



What do we need?

Ship management:

(base ship view)

to BUILD NEW SHIT on the ship. Also, tear down existing shit. Construction tab.
to CONTROL THE MONKEYS on the ship. Social tab.
to RESEARCH NEW SHIT. Research tab.
to DEFEND OUR SHIT. Military tab. 

Mission control:
to VIEW OUR OVERALL MISSION STATE AND PARAMETERS.
to SEND NIGGAS TO MINE MORE SHIT FOR OUR SHIP SO WE CAN BUILD MORE NEW SHIT. Missions tab.


Topdown approach:

Have MAIN MENU.
It has no eyecatch. Just a title and the main menu.

Press a button to show options.
