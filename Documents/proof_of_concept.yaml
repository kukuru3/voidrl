# in the scene hierarchy, there are two things happening:
#  a) UI elements such as buttons or "button events" send out events such as ui.button.hover
#  b) anywhere in hierearchy, "themers" or "skinners" are declared
#     skinners are simple, they only have one string field, and that is the theme ID
#     (in the above example, "ui_sterile")
#
