(day 8)



- scanner aesthetics imported from Scanner project
- set up libraries, dependencies
- project scaffolding (boring stuff, context, session, main menu logic, game states transition)

- Game "Screens":
    - main menu
    - "new game" screen: enter ship name, select options - can be merrged with main menu
    - galactic map (long range scanner) - you roam between the systems
    - ship status - displays colony ship
    - system map - move between planets inside a star system (or deep space locations)
    - a bunch of contextual menus (how do you send harvesters to harvest something? how do they know what to prioritize, etc.)

- logic:
    - "galaxy" class, seed, random generator
    - "galactic location" class - usually star system
    - procedural generator of galactic locations.
    - inside a galactic location: entities
    - do we have an abstraction level below galactic location? NO

    - large ship
    - small "space" unit (harvester, robot fighter, alien)
    - system feature - planets, rings, asteroids, etc.
    - 


Core loop (no aliens):
    - inspect neighbourhood select star system within jump range
    - start warp jump
    - generate system , enter system view
    - inspect system, see features
    - colony ship resource management;
    - Population
        - eat food, drink water

Resource system: 
    - primary resources: water, organic matter, construction materials, rare minerals
    (manufacturing into processed resources comes later)
    - stockpile resources
    - what happens if limited stockpile and we want to add to it? are resources lost?
    - are stockpiles global or localized? 
    - what happens if we run out of food or  water?


building ship structures and units
 - build stockpile
 - build residential
 - build Guardian unit 
 
 (reactor, engines, armor, etc. are implied but will be added later)
    
- scanner camera shows star system
